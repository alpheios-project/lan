Lane's Lexicon
This project is about editing and proofreading the text version of Lane's Lexicon originally created by Perseus project with the help of Alphios. 
The objective is to eliminate all errors with reference to printed version of Lane's Lexicon.
After a lot of online search, I managed to find an extremely fine print edition of Lane from 1863 by William and Norgate and puchased from an antique book seller in California.
An effort to scan this fine quality first edition is underway using super high quality production scanner at 600 x 600 DPI. 
The scanner model being used is KIC Bookeye 4 (thanks to the Washington University (Olin Library) in Saint Louis. 
This scanner produces extremely high quality images which are then OCR'ed and optimized for pdf size.
